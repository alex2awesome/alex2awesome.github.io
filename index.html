<p>I am a data scientist, pianist and student based in New York City. I work at The New York Times.</a></p>

<p>My work at the Times has involved business-side statistical modeling and launching data science products, where I have been involved in relaunching the <a href="https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/building-the-next-new-york-times-recommendation-engine/?_r=0">article recommendation engine</a>, building tools to help journalists, and modeling <a href="https://digiday.com/media/get-10m-subscribers-new-york-times-focusing-churn/">subscriber risk profiles</a>.
  </p>
  <p>I am also interested in data journalism and visualization. <a href="/data-vis.html">Check out my work, here.</a></p>
  <p>For fun, I have worked as a professional bassist and pianist in off-Broadway productions in the city, with plays including <a href="https://myny.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/content/leibowitzs-2011-production-dybbuk">The Dybbuk</a> and <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/04/the-gospel-according-to-brit-brit-musical-tells-the-story-of-christ-through-britney-spears-songs/">Spears: The Gospel According to Brittney.</a></p>
